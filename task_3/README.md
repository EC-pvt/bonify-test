Please build an application that uses the Google Maps API and Youtube API to grab and display the latest videos by a location defined on the map.

Please add small back/forward functionality which will allow user to go throw the history of selected map locations in current session( visually it should be only two buttons “Back” and “Forward” on the screen). Please make any assumptions on your own and feel free to simplify or make the solution more complex. Please write your assumptions if taken.
Expected result: running web application in React.

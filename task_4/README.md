# Frontend Team Lead Challenge

## Question 4

#### Babel plugin

The babel plugin can be tested directly into the task 3.
When adding a location on the map, the app logs some information and the plugin transforms it accordingly.

See `task_3/src/Home/template.jsx` at line 18 to play with the console.
